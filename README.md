# Physics Simulation Engine

<br/>

## Presentation
A framework to edit in real time P5 sketches.

<br/>

## How to develop

To run the engine on your local device, you'll first need to install [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en/).

You then have two commands that you can run inside the folder `p5-sketch-editor` :
 - `npm run watch` : creates a local server accessible on `localhost:8080`, which automatically restarts and compiles when modifications on the engine are made. The runned files are located into the `dev/` folder.
 - `npm run build` : compiles the new pSEngine code inside the `dist/` folder.
